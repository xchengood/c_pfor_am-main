Instructions for:
Neper 4.0.2
GMSH 3.0.6
used on Ubuntu 18

Generate tessellation and mesh using neper,
for instance:

neper -T -n 2 -id 1 -domain "cube(3,3,3)"
neper -M n2-id1.tess -elttype 'hex' -cl 1.0

The mesh file generated n2-id1.msh will not be compatible with MOOSE
because it is based on a more recent version of gmsh

Make a copy of the mesh file, for instance called n2-id2.msh
Open this file using GMSH 3.0.6
Save mesh (it will overwrite the file that you just opened)

This new version of the mesh file is compatible with MOOSE
but the physical volumes that represent grains are not imported
automatically

Open the old mesh file (n2-id1.msh), copy and paste the 
$PhysicalNames block to the new file (see for instance n2-id2.msh)
Remove the boundaries x0, x1, et cetera
that are automatically generated by Neper as these will not
be present in the new mesh file (n2-id2.msh)

Remember to change the number of physical entities
just after the $PhysicalNames because 6 boundary physical entities
have been removed, so the number of remaining entities will be
the number of grains

For instance for a bicrystal:

$PhysicalNames
2
3 1 poly1
3 2 poly2
$EndPhysicalNames
